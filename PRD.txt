PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD): FARMGPT WEB (PWA)
============================================================
Project Name: FarmGPT Web Implementation
Version: 2.0 (Migration from WhatsApp Design)
Target Market: Malaysia (B40 Smallholders)
Date: February 15, 2026

1.⁠ ⁠EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FarmGPT Web is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed 
to provide Malaysian smallholders with an interactive dashboard 
for crop health, precision weather analytics, and subsidy management. 
By moving to a PWA, we gain offline capabilities (Edge AI) and 
richer geospatial data visualization.

2.⁠ ⁠USER PERSONAS
•⁠  ⁠Smallholder (Oil Palm/Paddy): Needs fast, offline disease 
  diagnosis and clear "Action/No-Action" weather alerts.
•⁠  ⁠Extension Officer (MARDI): Needs a centralized "Disease Atlas" 
  to track regional outbreaks.

3.⁠ ⁠FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Offline-First Image Recognition (Edge AI)
•⁠  ⁠Requirement: Must perform diagnosis without active 4G/5G.
•⁠  ⁠Technology: TensorFlow.js model cached locally.
•⁠  ⁠Crops: Oil Palm (Basal Stem Rot), Paddy (Rice Blast), 
  Rubber (Leaf diseases), Cocoa (Frosty Pod Rot).

3.2 "My Farm" Geospatial Dashboard
•⁠  ⁠Requirement: Map-based interface for farm boundaries.
•⁠  ⁠Visualization: Overlay local pest pressure and weather 
  forecasts directly onto the user's plot location.

3.3 Government Subsidy Navigator
•⁠  ⁠Requirement: Simplify the B40 grant application process.
•⁠  ⁠Features: OCR scanning for NRIC/Land Titles, auto-filling 
  MDEC/MARDI digital forms, and deadline reminders.

3.4 Community Knowledge Loop
•⁠  ⁠Requirement: Peer-to-peer social learning.
•⁠  ⁠Feature: Anonymized "Success Stories" based on similar 
  soil types and regional micro-climates.

3.5 Gemini AI Integration (The Intelligence Layer)
- Task: Transform raw data into conversational, expert advice.
- Multimodal: Parse images and text documents (Subsidies/Manuals).
- Regional Support: Support for Malay dialects (Kedah, Kelantan, etc.)
  via Gemini’s native multilingual capabilities.
- Weather Synthesis: Use Gemini to correlate weather APIs with 
  pesticide application windows for "Precision Advice."
  
4.⁠ ⁠TECHNICAL STACK
•⁠  ⁠Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS.
•⁠  ⁠PWA Layer: Workbox (Service Workers for offline caching).
•⁠  ⁠Machine Learning: TensorFlow.js (In-browser inference).
•⁠  ⁠Backend: Google Cloud Functions + Firebase.
•⁠  ⁠Data Integration: MetMalaysia API, MARDI Database, MDEC Portal.

5.⁠ ⁠KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
•⁠  ⁠Yield Increase: Targeted 15% average increase.
•⁠  ⁠Cost Reduction: 8-12% reduction in fertilizer waste.
•⁠  ⁠Offline Usage: >50% of diagnoses performed in offline mode.
•⁠  ⁠User Retention: DAU/MAU ratio of >40%.

6.⁠ ⁠RISK MITIGATION
•⁠  ⁠Device Compatibility: Support for Android Go and older browsers.
•⁠  ⁠Model Size: Keep quantized ML models under 20MB for fast 
  initial download.
